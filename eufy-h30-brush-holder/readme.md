H30 Brush Holder
================

The vacuum cleaner [H30 infinity][eufy] contains (beside other things) a
motorized brush adapter. This comes with a small cleaning brush that has no
place to be stored.

Also there is a wall mount that could hold two parts, but only one fitting
there is included, the other one is used for another add on that's not included
in the "infinity" package.

This model fits on the second parts holder place and has a small hole
to hold the small brush.
